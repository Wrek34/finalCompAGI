Attention To use the OpenAI API with Auto-GPT, we strongly recommend setting up billing (AKA paid account). Free accounts are limited to 3 API calls per minute, which can cause the application to crash. You can set up a paid account at Manage account > Billing > Overview . Important It's highly recommended that you keep track of your API costs on the Usage page . You can also set limits on how much you spend on the Usage limits page . Setting up Auto-GPT Set up with Docker Make sure you have Docker installed, see requirements Create a project directory for Auto-GPT mkdir Auto-GPT cd Auto-GPT In the project directory, create a file called docker-compose.yml with the following contents: version : \"3.9\" services : auto-gpt : image : significantgravitas/auto-gpt env_file : - .env profiles : [ \"exclude-from-up\" ] volumes : - ./auto_gpt_workspace:/app/autogpt/auto_gpt_workspace - ./data:/app/data ## allow auto-gpt to write logs to disk - ./logs:/app/logs ## uncomment following lines if you want to make use of these files ## you must have them existing in the same folder as this docker-compose.yml #- type: bind # source: ./azure.yaml # target: /app/azure.yaml #- type: bind # source: ./ai_settings.yaml # target: /app/ai_settings.yaml Create the necessary configuration files. If needed, you can find templates in the repository . Pull the latest image from Docker Hub docker pull significantgravitas/auto-gpt Continue to Run with Docker Docker only supports headless browsing Auto-GPT uses a browser in headless mode by default: HEADLESS_BROWSER=True . Please do not change this setting in combination with Docker, or Auto-GPT will crash. Set up with Git Important Make sure you have Git installed for your OS. Executing commands To execute the given commands, open a CMD, Bash, or Powershell window. On Windows: press Win + X and pick Terminal , or Win + R and enter cmd Clone the repository git clone -b stable https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT.git Navigate to the directory where you downloaded the repository cd Auto-GPT Set up without Git/Docker Warning We recommend to use Git or Docker, to make updating easier. Also note that some features such as Python execution will only work inside docker for security reasons. Download Source code (zip) from the latest stable release Extract the zip-file into a folder Configuration Find the file named .env.template in the main Auto-GPT folder. This file may be hidden by default in some operating systems due to the dot prefix. To reveal hidden files, follow the instructions for your specific operating system: Windows , macOS . Create a copy of .env.template and call it .env ; if you're already in a command prompt/terminal window: cp .env.template .env . Open the .env file in a text editor. Find the line that says OPENAI_API_KEY= . After the = , enter your unique OpenAI API Key without any quotes or spaces . Enter any other API keys or tokens for services you would like to use. Note To activate and adjust a setting, remove the # prefix. Save and close the .env file. Using a GPT Azure-instance If you want to use GPT on an Azure instance, set USE_AZURE to True and make an Azure configuration file: Rename azure.yaml.template to azure.yaml and provide the relevant azure_api_base , azure_api_version and all the deployment IDs for the relevant models in the azure_model_map section: fast_llm_model_deployment_id : your gpt-3.5-turbo or gpt-4 deployment ID smart_llm_model_deployment_id : your gpt-4 deployment ID embedding_model_deployment_id : your text-embedding-ada-002 v2 deployment ID Example: # Please specify all of these values as double-quoted strings # Replace string in angled brackets (<>) to your own deployment Name azure_model_map : fast_llm_model_deployment_id : \"<auto-gpt-deployment>\" ... Details can be found in the openai-python docs , and in the Azure OpenAI docs for the embedding model. If you're on Windows you may need to install an MSVC library . Running Auto-GPT Run with Docker Easiest is to use docker-compose . Important: Docker Compose version 1.29.0 or later is required to use version 3.9 of the Compose file format. You can check the version of Docker Compose installed on your system by running the following command: docker-compose version This will display the version of Docker Compose that is currently installed on your system. If you need to upgrade Docker Compose to a newer version, you can follow the installation instructions in the Docker documentation: https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/ Once you have a recent version of docker-compose, run the commands below in your Auto-GPT folder. Build the image. If you have pulled the image from Docker Hub, skip this step (NOTE: You will need to do this if you are modifying requirements.txt to add/remove dependencies like Python libs/frameworks) docker-compose build auto-gpt Run Auto-GPT docker-compose run --rm auto-gpt By default, this will also start and attach a Redis memory backend. If you do not want this, comment or remove the depends: - redis and redis: sections from docker-compose.yml . For related settings, see Memory > Redis setup . You can pass extra arguments, e.g. running with --gpt3only and --continuous : docker-compose run --rm auto-gpt --gpt3only --continuous If you dare, you can also build and run it with \"vanilla\" docker commands: docker build -t auto-gpt . docker run -it --env-file = .env -v $PWD :/app auto-gpt docker run -it --env-file = .env -v $PWD :/app --rm auto-gpt --gpt3only --continuous Run with Dev Container Install the Remote - Containers extension in VS Code. Open command palette with F1 and type Dev Containers: Open Folder in Container . Run ./run.sh . Run without Docker Create a Virtual Environment Create a virtual environment to run in. python -m venv venvAutoGPT source venvAutoGPT/bin/activate pip3 install --upgrade pip Warning Due to security reasons, certain features (like Python execution) will by default be disabled when running without docker. So, even if you want to run the program outside a docker container, you currently still need docker to actually run scripts. Simply run the startup script in your terminal. This will install any necessary Python packages and launch Auto-GPT. On Linux/MacOS: ./run.sh On Windows: . \\r un.bat If this gives errors, make sure you have a compatible Python version installed.

This scenario is an advanced form of the classic \"Sally-Anne test\", a psychological test used to measure a child's social cognitive ability to understand that others' perspectives and beliefs may differ from their own. Here is an explanation of the challenge: The AI is given a series of events involving characters Sally, Anne, Bob, and Charlie, and the movements of different marbles. These events are designed as tests at increasing levels of complexity. For each level, the AI is expected to keep track of the events and the resulting beliefs of each character about the locations of each marble. These beliefs are affected by whether the character was inside or outside the room when events occurred, as characters inside the room are aware of the actions, while characters outside the room aren't. After the AI processes the events and generates the beliefs of each character, it writes these beliefs to an output file in JSON format. The check_beliefs function then checks the AI's beliefs against the expected beliefs for that level. The expected beliefs are predefined and represent the correct interpretation of the events for each level. If the AI's beliefs match the expected beliefs, it means the AI has correctly interpreted the events and the perspectives of each character. This would indicate that the AI has passed the test for that level. The test runs for levels up to the maximum level that the AI has successfully beaten, or up to a user-selected level. Files instructions_1.txt \"Sally has a marble (marble A) and she puts it in her basket (basket S), then leaves the room. Anne moves marble A from Sally's basket (basket S) to her own basket (basket A).\", instructions_2.txt \"Sally gives a new marble (marble B) to Bob who is outside with her. Bob goes into the room and places marble B into Anne's basket (basket A). Anne tells Bob to tell Sally that he lost the marble b. Bob leaves the room and speaks to Sally about the marble B. Meanwhile, after Bob left the room, Anne moves marble A into the green box, but tells Charlie to tell Sally that marble A is under the sofa. Charlie leaves the room and speak to Sally about the marble A as instructed by Anne.\", ...and so on. instructions_n.txt The expected believes of every characters are given in a list: expected_beliefs = { 1: { 'Sally': { 'marble A': 'basket S', }, 'Anne': { 'marble A': 'basket A', } }, 2: { 'Sally': { 'marble A': 'sofa', # Because Charlie told her }, 'Anne': { 'marble A': 'green box', # Because she moved it there 'marble B': 'basket A', # Because Bob put it there and she was in the room }, 'Bob': { 'B': 'basket A', # Last place he put it }, 'Charlie': { 'A': 'sofa', # Because Anne told him to tell Sally so } },... Objective This test essentially checks if an AI can accurately model and track the beliefs of different characters based on their knowledge of events, which is a critical aspect of understanding and generating human-like narratives.

Here is an explanation of the challenge: The AI is given a series of events involving characters Sally, Anne, Bob, and Charlie, and the movements of different marbles. These events are designed as tests at increasing levels of complexity. For each level, the AI is expected to keep track of the events and the resulting beliefs of each character about the locations of each marble. These beliefs are affected by whether the character was inside or outside the room when events occurred, as characters inside the room are aware of the actions, while characters outside the room aren't. After the AI processes the events and generates the beliefs of each character, it writes these beliefs to an output file in JSON format. The check_beliefs function then checks the AI's beliefs against the expected beliefs for that level. The expected beliefs are predefined and represent the correct interpretation of the events for each level. If the AI's beliefs match the expected beliefs, it means the AI has correctly interpreted the events and the perspectives of each character. This would indicate that the AI has passed the test for that level. The test runs for levels up to the maximum level that the AI has successfully beaten, or up to a user-selected level.","title":"Description"},{"location":"challenges/memory/challenge_d/#files","text":"instructions_1.txt \"Sally has a marble (marble A) and she puts it in her basket (basket S), then leaves the room.

Note that you can also use the --file argument to ingest a single file into memory and that data_ingestion.py will only ingest files within the /auto_gpt_workspace directory. The DIR path is relative to the auto_gpt_workspace directory, so python data_ingestion.py --dir . --init will ingest everything in auto_gpt_workspace directory. You can adjust the max_length and overlap parameters to fine-tune the way the documents are presented to the AI when it \"recall\" that memory: Adjusting the overlap value allows the AI to access more contextual information from each chunk when recalling information, but will result in more chunks being created and therefore increase memory backend usage and OpenAI API requests. Reducing the max_length value will create more chunks, which can save prompt tokens by allowing for more message history in the context, but will also increase the number of chunks. Increasing the max_length value will provide the AI with more contextual information from each chunk, reducing the number of chunks created and saving on OpenAI API requests. However, this may also use more prompt tokens and decrease the overall context available to the AI. Memory pre-seeding is a technique for improving AI accuracy by ingesting relevant data into its memory. Chunks of data are split and added to memory, allowing the AI to access them quickly and generate more accurate responses. It's useful for large datasets or when specific information needs to be accessed quickly. Examples include ingesting API or GitHub documentation before running Auto-GPT. Attention If you use Redis for memory, make sure to run Auto-GPT with WIPE_REDIS_ON_START=False For other memory backends, we currently forcefully wipe the memory when starting Auto-GPT. To ingest data with those memory backends, you can call the data_ingestion.py script anytime during an Auto-GPT run.
